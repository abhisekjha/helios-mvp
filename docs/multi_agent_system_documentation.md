## 🤖 Agent Details

### 1. 🧭 RouterAgent (The Brain)

**Role**: Query Classification & Planning

**Capabilities**:
- Analyzes query intent and complexity (1-10 scale)
- Classifies into 7 types: `simple_lookup`, `aggregation`, `trend_analysis`, `comparison`, `multi_step_complex`, `planning_request`, `general_question`
- Creates execution plans with required tools
- Handles fallback classification when AI fails

**Key Configuration**:
```python
available_tools = {
    "vector_search": "Search uploaded data using semantic similarity",
    "data_aggregation": "Perform calculations and aggregations on data", 
    "trend_analysis": "Analyze patterns and trends over time",
    "comparison": "Compare different data points or periods",
    "insights_generation": "Generate strategic insights from data"
}
```

**System Prompt**:
```
You are an expert query classifier for a business analytics system.
Available tools: vector_search, data_aggregation, trend_analysis, comparison...

Analyze the user's query and classify it according to these types:
- simple_data_lookup: Looking for specific data points
- aggregation_analysis: Requires calculations (sum, average, count, etc.)
- trend_analysis: Looking for patterns over time
- comparison_query: Comparing different items/periods
- multi_step_complex: Requires multiple operations or reasoning steps
- planning_request: Asking for strategic advice or planning
- general_question: General questions about the data or system

Return JSON with: query_type, confidence, intent, entities, requires_tools, complexity_score, estimated_steps
```

### 2. 🔍 RetrievalAgent (The Data Hunter)

**Role**: Multi-Source Data Retrieval & Business Intelligence

**Capabilities**:
- Vector search with semantic similarity (FAISS + SentenceTransformers)
- CSV analysis with 43+ business intelligence insights per query
- Query expansion for low-quality searches (similarity < 0.3)
- Data quality scoring and validation

**Business Intelligence Engine**:
- **Revenue Analysis**: "$6.49M total, $540K monthly average, $456K-$712K range"
- **Customer Segmentation**: "13 high-value customers ($2,116 avg spend), 11 at-risk churn (27.5%)"
- **Marketing ROI**: "Facebook/Instagram campaigns: 10.0 ROAS, Email: 8.5 ROAS"
- **Product Performance**: "Top categories with margin analysis, price optimization opportunities"
- **Sales Trends**: "-41.2% price trend, seasonal patterns, growth opportunities"

**Enhanced CSV Analysis**:
```python
def _analyze_csv_data(self, df, file_name):
    insights = []
    numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns
    
    for col in numeric_columns:
        # Revenue/Financial Analysis
        total = df[col].sum()
        avg = df[col].mean()
        insights.append(f"{col} Analysis: Total ${total:,.0f}, Average ${avg:.0f}")
        
        # Trend Analysis
        if len(df) >= 10:
            early_avg = df[col].head(5).mean()
            recent_avg = df[col].tail(5).mean()
            trend = ((recent_avg - early_avg) / early_avg) * 100
            insights.append(f"{col} Trend: {trend:+.1f}% change from early to recent period")
    
    # Customer Segmentation
    if 'Customer_Segment' in df.columns:
        segments = df['Customer_Segment'].value_counts()
        insights.append(f"Customer Segments: {dict(segments)}")
    
    # High-Value Customer Analysis
    if 'Total_Spend' in df.columns:
        high_value = df[df['Total_Spend'] > df['Total_Spend'].quantile(0.7)]
        insights.append(f"High-Value Customers: {len(high_value)} customers (${high_value['Total_Spend'].mean():.0f} avg spend)")
```

### 3. 🎨 SynthesizerAgent (The Storyteller)

**Role**: Response Generation & Strategic Insights

**Capabilities**:
- Combines data from ALL sources (fixed critical bug: was only using first 10 items)
- Generates comprehensive business responses (2,000+ characters)
- Extracts key insights and actionable recommendations
- Confidence scoring and source attribution
- Executive-level formatting

**Key Fix Implemented**:
```python
# BEFORE (Bug): Only processed first 10 items
for item in retrieved_data[:10]:  # ❌ CSV data was at positions 15-17

# AFTER (Fixed): Process ALL items
for item in retrieved_data:  # ✅ Now finds CSV data everywhere
```

**Enhanced Context Creation**:
```python
async def _generate_main_response(self, query, retrieved_data, synthesis_type):
    context_chunks = []
    csv_data_found = False
    total_csv_insights = 0
    
    for item in retrieved_data:  # Process ALL items
        if item.get("type") == "csv_data":
            csv_data_found = True
            file_name = item.get("metadata", {}).get("file_name", "uploaded data")
            data_insights = item.get("data_insights", [])
            total_csv_insights += len(data_insights)
            
            # Priority 1: Business insights from enhanced analysis
            csv_context = f"📊 BUSINESS DATA FILE: {file_name}\n"
            csv_context += f"💡 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS:\n"
            for insight in data_insights:
                csv_context += f"• {insight}\n"
            
            context_chunks.append(f"[HIGH RELEVANCE CSV DATA - Score: {score:.2f}]\n{csv_context}")
```
