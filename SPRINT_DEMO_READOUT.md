# Helios Sprint Demo Readout (August 15, 2025)

## 1. Executive Snapshot
Helios is an AI-native business intelligence copilot that lets a user upload structured CSV data, ask natural language questions, and receive **data‑grounded, executive‑grade insights**. We have completed the MVP knowledge base workflow (Sprint S6) and the multi‑agent intelligence layer (Sprint S7). We are now poised to begin Sprint S8 (Auditor Agent – claim validation) which extends Helios from *insight generation* to *data trust & compliance*.

**Status:** Core foundation + multi-agent reasoning COMPLETE ✅ | Entering Automation Phase (S8–S9)

---
## 2. Product Vision & Problem Statement
**Problem:** Business teams lose time stitching spreadsheets, running manual pivots, and waiting on analysts for ad‑hoc answers and validation of financial / promotion claims.

**Vision:** A conversational, agentic analytics platform that:
- Converts raw operational data into a living knowledge base
- Understands intent, decomposes complex questions, and synthesizes strategic recommendations
- Validates external / internal claims (Auditor) and proactively optimizes spend & allocation (Treasurer)
- Surfaces executive dashboards for portfolio‑level decisions

**North Star Outcome:** Reduce time from question → trustworthy, actionable insight from hours to seconds/minutes while increasing confidence in decisions.

## 3. What We Have Built So Far (S0–S7)
### 3.1 Foundation (Earlier Sprints)
- User Authentication (JWT) & secure API scaffolding
- Goal entity & data upload pipeline (CSV → chunking → embeddings → vector store)
- Knowledge base creation & isolation per goal
- Streaming chat interface (frontend) with goal context & source attribution

### 3.2 Sprint S6 (Knowledge Base & Conversational UI) ✅
- Vector Embedding Service (SentenceTransformers + FAISS)
- Automatic post‑upload processing (Celery) → chunking + embeddings + metadata
- `/api/v1/agent/query` endpoint (initial single‑agent retrieval + LLM synthesis)
- Frontend real streaming chat, typing indicators, error states & source panels

### 3.3 Sprint S7 (Multi‑Agent Intelligence Layer) ✅
| Component | Key Capabilities |
|-----------|------------------|
| RouterAgent | Intent classification (7 types), complexity scoring, execution planning, fallback logic |
| RetrievalAgent | Semantic vector search, query expansion, multi‑file BI extraction (43+ business insights per query), aggregation & basic statistics |

## 5. Sprint Roadmap (Now → S10)
| Sprint | Theme | Outcome | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| S6 | Knowledge Base + Conversational UI | End‑to‑end Q&A on uploaded data | ✅ Complete |
| S7 | Multi-Agent Reasoning | Complex, multi‑step, data‑grounded insights | ✅ Complete |
| S8 | Auditor Agent (Claim Validation) | Trust layer: validate claim files vs data | ▶ Starting |
| S9 | Treasurer Agent (Optimization) | Proactive spend / budget optimization | Planned |
| S10 | Executive Dashboards & Hardening | Visual exec insights + production readiness | Planned |

---
## 6. Upcoming Sprint (S8) – Auditor Agent
**Goal:** Add a verification layer that ingests “claim files” (e.g., promotion reimbursement claims, invoices) and validates them against authoritative uploaded data to flag inconsistencies and revenue leakage.

### 6.1 Key Deliverables
- Claim file upload type & schema (frontend + backend)
- `auditor_agent.py` with 3‑point validation (entity / amount / contextual timeframe)
- Validation Celery pipeline (async parsing → entity extraction → cross‑reference)
- Result persistence (status, discrepancies, confidence, remediation hints)
- UI dashboard for claim validation results (filter, detail drawer, approve / reject)

### 6.2 Acceptance Criteria
- User can upload a claim file and see it enter “Processing” → “Validated”/“Failed”
- System produces structured variance report (per line item) with percentage delta
- Discrepancies above configurable threshold flagged with severity level
- Validation results link back to source data rows (traceability)
- Auditor Agent streams progress states (Parsing, Matching, Reconciling, Summarizing)

### 6.3 Technical Approach (High-Level)
- New collection: `claim_validation_results`
- Celery task: `process_claim_file(claim_file_id)` triggers auditor pipeline
- Entity extraction: lightweight pattern / heuristic + optional LLM fallback
- Matching strategy: deterministic join (IDs) → fuzzy fallback (similarity)
- Confidence scoring: (match completeness * amount agreement * temporal alignment)

### 6.4 Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| OCR / parsing complexity | Delays ingestion | Start with structured CSV claim format; defer OCR to later iteration |
| High false positives | User trust erosion | Tune thresholds; add explainability messaging |
| Performance on large claim files | Latency | Stream progress + incremental commits |
| LLM hallucination in validation rationale | Misleading output | Keep reasoning constrained to matched rows & calculated diffs |

---
## 7. Future (S9–S10) Preview
- **Treasurer Agent:** Scheduled performance scans, ROI shift detection, reallocation recommendations (with projected impact).  
- **Dashboards:** Portfolio KPIs (Revenue trend, ROI by channel, Churn risk, Inventory risk), drill‑through to agent rationale, exportable executive summary.

---
## 8. Demo Script (Suggested Flow – 8–10 Minutes)
| Minute | Action | Narrative Value |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 0:00 | Intro slide (Vision + Problem) | Frame value proposition |
| 0:45 | Show Goal dashboard & upload datasets | Foundation & usability |
| 2:00 | Open chat, ask simple lookup ("Top 3 revenue products?") | Fast, relevant metrics |
| 3:00 | Ask complex multi‑step query (strategic plan) | Multi-agent reasoning depth |
| 5:00 | Highlight streaming steps & confidence indicators | Transparency & trust |
| 6:00 | Show source attribution & BI insight extraction (explain metric provenance) | Data grounding |
| 7:00 | Preview upcoming Auditor Agent UI placeholder (wireframe / plan) | Roadmap credibility |
| 8:30 | Close with KPI improvements & next sprint objectives | Momentum & ask |

### Sample Strategic Query
"Analyze my uploaded data and create a prioritized action plan to increase Q4 revenue by 25%. Include revenue drivers, customer retention tactics, marketing optimization, and inventory focus."

### What To Verbally Emphasize
- Real data (7 CSV domains) not synthetic filler
- Agent orchestration (classification → retrieval → synthesis)
- Business intelligence enrichment layer (43+ generated insights per query)
- Confidence & explainability (sources, metrics, rationale)
- Upcoming trust & optimization layers (Auditor, Treasurer)

---
## 9. KPIs & Success Metrics
| Category | Current | Target Post S10 |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Query data-grounding rate | 100% | Maintain 100% |
| Avg strategic query turnaround | ~26.6s | <18s (optimization & caching) |
| Avg actionable recommendations / strategic query | 6–10 | 8–12 (richer planning) |
| Validation precision (S8) | N/A | >90% (pilot datasets) |
| Optimization recommendation adoption (S9) | N/A | >60% accepted |
| Exec dashboard load time (S10) | N/A | <3s initial view |

---
## 10. Differentiators (Why This Matters)
- Multi-agent *reasoning*, not template QA
- Embedded BI extraction layer feeding synthesis (bridges structured + semantic worlds)
- Streaming transparency for trust (work-in-progress narrative)
- Extensible pipeline for validation & optimization (beyond passive analytics)
- Designed for executive consumption (strategic framing + metrics + actions)

---
## 11. Immediate Next Steps (Next 7–10 Days)
1. Finalize claim file schema & upload endpoint modifications
2. Implement Auditor Agent skeleton + streaming progress events
3. Build validation result data model + Celery pipeline
4. Deliver initial variance computation & severity scoring
5. Frontend: stub claim validation dashboard (list + detail drawer)
6. Integration test (upload → validate → view results)
7. Update documentation & add minimal QA test cases

---
## 12. Open Questions / Decisions Needed
| Question | Needed By | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Claim file initial format (CSV vs PDF w/ OCR) | Day 2 of Sprint S8 | Recommend CSV v1, defer OCR |
| Severity threshold defaults | Before scoring code | Proposed: Low >2%, Medium >5%, High >10% variance |
| Auditor explanation detail level | Before synthesis prompt | Keep concise: (Field, Expected, Actual, Delta, Rationale) |

---
## 13. Risks & Mitigation (Program Level)
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Scope creep in Auditor (OCR, NLP heavy) | Strict MVP contract: structured claims first |
| Latency scaling with data volume | Introduce result caching & partial retrieval windows |
| Model cost escalation | Cache embeddings & reuse high-similarity synthetic summaries |
| Stakeholder expectation inflation | Clearly stage roadmap (Insight → Trust → Optimization → Dashboards) |

---
## 14. Stakeholder Ask
- Endorse narrowed MVP scope for Auditor (structured claims only)
- Greenlight minor infra budget for caching & performance instrumentation
- Provide 1–2 real (anonymized) claim file examples for calibration
